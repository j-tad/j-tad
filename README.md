Hi, I'm Jacob

I concentrate in Computer Science @ Carleton University.

Currently building Keeboard, making typing feel personal, while supporting independent Shopify vendors.

Past work spans search engines, web apps, and system-level utilities.

Currently exploring machine learning, cryptography, and systems programming.

Open to co-op opportunities for Summer/Fall 2025.
