hi, i'm jacob 👋

i'm concentrated in computer science

currently i'm building a platform to make typing on keyboards feel personal, while supporting independent shopify vendors. 
my past experience spans across building search engines, web apps, and system-level utilities.
i'm interested in learning more about machine learning, cryptography, and systems programming.

open to co-op opportunities for summer/fall 2025
