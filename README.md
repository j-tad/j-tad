hi, i'm jacob

i'm concentrated in computer science @ carleton university

currently i'm building a platform to make typing on keyboards feel personal, while supporting independent shopify vendors. 
my past experience spans across building search engines, web apps, and system-level utilities.
i'm interested in learning more about machine learning, cryptography, and systems programming.

open to co-op opportunities for summer/fall 2025 you can reach me on [X](https://x.com/jtadsn)
